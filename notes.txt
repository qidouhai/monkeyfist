How to setup imagick for apache on Windows(from: http://php.net/manual/de/imagick.setup.php):
Steps to Install ImageMagick on UwAmp for Windows:
as of March 31, 2016

1. Open PHPInfo and check:
   Architecture = x86 or x64
   Thread Safety = yes or no

2. Download ImageMagick from:

   http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/deps/

   In my case I downloaded: ImageMagick-6.9.3-7-vc11-x86.zip
   because the Architecture under PHPInfo is x86
   as for vc11 or vc14
   search google for "visual c++ 11 runtime" or
   "visual c++ 14 runtime" and install it

3. Unzip and copy all dlls from the bin subfolder to the
    Apache bin directory. It's a bunch of CORE_RL_*.dll
    and IM_MOD_RL_*.dll plus a few other dlls.

    In my case, I installed UwAmp in C:\UwAmp, so:
    (from zip) bin/*.dll --> C:\UwAmp\bin\apache\bin

4. Goto:

    http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick

    as of today, latest is 3.4.1 so I went to:
    http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick/3.4.1/windows

    My PHP version is: 5.6.18, and Thread Safety is Yes from
    Step #1, so I downloaded:
       5.6 Thread Safe (TS) x86
    I got: php_imagick-3.4.1-5.6-ts-vc11-x86.zip

5. Unzip and copy "php_imagick.dll" to the php extension folder:

    In my case:
    php_imagick.dll --> C:\UwAmp\bin\php\php-5.6.18\ext

    Note: this ZIP also contains dlls which other guides says
    to extract to the extension folder of apache.
    NO NEED TO DO IT. Step #3 has taken care of it.

6. Edit "php.ini" and add at the very end (could be 
    anywhere I suppose):

      [Imagick]
      extension=php_imagick.dll

      For super newbies: click the edit button in the UwAmp UI,
      "php_uwamp.ini" will open and edit it. It will be copied to
      the correct php.ini when UwAmp is restarted. I had 
      trouble at first since there are several php*.ini scattered 
      all over.

7. Restart Apache

8. Check PHPInfo
    scroll to section (or find): imagick    
    number of supported formats: 234

    If there is no "imagick" section or "supported format" is 0,
    something went wrong.


Dont forget to change upload_max_filesize in php.ini for image upload!
